# graph_examples
Examples of basic graph analysis algorithms (Krustal's MST, Dijkstra's)

## Dependencies

This package expects a modern version Python3. For visualization we also rely on graphviz, which can be installed via the following:

```bash
pip install graphviz
```

## Execution

To call the top level script, run the following:

```bash
python3 execute.py
```

This will run the basic algorithms against the included graph information and create a 'graph.pdf' showing the graph structure.
